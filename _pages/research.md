### Research Interests

I explore how to build interactive systems that fit people’s needs and contexts, especially when these systems involve complex or intelligent behaviors. My goal is to help non-expert users better understand and make use of these technologies in meaningful ways.

I contribute methodologies, tools, and interfaces based on a human-centered approach to support appropriation and sensemaking, while helping designers and developers create systems that are better adapted to real-world use.

To do so, I draw on methods from both human-computer interaction and software engineering: iterative design, user studies (qualitative and quantitative), systematic reviews, etc.

I’ve applied this approach in areas such as ambient assisted living (helping ageing experts make sense of smart home services) and explainable AI (designing interfaces that help non-experts interpret algorithmic decisions).
