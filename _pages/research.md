### Research Interests

I design and evaluate interactive systems that adapt to people’s needs, abilities, and contexts. I am particularly interested in intelligent and data-driven systems, where considering human factors is essential to ensure usability, foster trust, and enable effective interaction.

Through interdisciplinary collaborations combining computer science with psychology and cognitive ergonomics, I contribute user-centered methods and develop tool support to address both technical and cognitive challenges, with software engineering techniques providing a complementary foundation. This work spans domains such as explainable AI in healthcare, smart home technologies for aging in place, and visualization tools to support decision-making.

The ultimate goal of my research is to support the design and use of intelligent systems in real-world contexts, ensuring they remain usable, transparent, and beneficial for the people who rely on them.

<!--I explore how to build interactive systems that fit people’s needs and contexts, especially when these systems involve complex or intelligent behaviors. 
My goal is to help non-expert users better understand and make use of these technologies in meaningful ways.

I contribute methodologies, tools, and interfaces based on a human-centered approach to support appropriation and sensemaking, while helping designers and developers create systems that are better adapted to real-world use.

To do so, I draw on methods from both human-computer interaction and software engineering: iterative design, user studies (qualitative and quantitative), systematic reviews, etc.

I’ve applied this approach in areas such as ambient assisted living (e.g., helping ageing experts make sense of smart home services) and explainable AI (e.g., designing interfaces that help non-experts interpret algorithmic decisions).

I have established collaborations with cognitive psychology and gerontology teams, working on topics such as technology adoption, self-determination, and quality of life in aging populations. These collaborations allow me to combine HCI and computer science perspectives with cognitive and psychosocial insights, resulting in joint publications in HCI and interdisciplinary venues.-->
